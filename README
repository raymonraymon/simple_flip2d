Code is generally uncommented: do not ask me for more details if you cannot
work it out by yourself. A better documented version with more features will
come down the road.

To compile the simulation:
1) edit Makefile.defs for your architecture
2) "make depend"
3) either "make" or "make release" (optimized version)

Do the same thing for the code in the subdirectory "viewflip2d",
which is a simple 2D viewer for the simulation output.
